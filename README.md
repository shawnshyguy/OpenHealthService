# Open Health Service ⛑️

OHS is an easy-in, easy-out digital health management tool.

Designed from the ground-up to easily import and export health and related data, OHS aims to be a private bridge to consolidate all your health data into a singular source.

## Installation

TBD

## Recommendations

Although OHS can be deployed publicly-facing, we recommend most users deploy it at home, without any port-forwarding, to ensure your data stays secure. If you are using an instance of OHS hosted by someone else, **please make sure you are comfortable with this person having access to any information you provide.**.

## Invite to Contribution

I by no means a master when it comes to any of the technologies I have implemented here. While I have prior experience with all, there is still much I could learn. While I aim to make no less than a functional product, there is no saying that what I've made is the most *optimal* or even *scaleable*... if I have implemented anything in a way that might seem obtuse to you, please let me know and I would be more than happy to correct it. Forks and pull requests are also more than welcome. If you'd like to contribute to design, or the WebGUI, or even just make a suggestion for something to add -- please don't hesistate to do so :)
